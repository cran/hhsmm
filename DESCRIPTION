Description: Develops algorithms for fitting, prediction, simulation 
  and initialization of the hidden hybrid Markov/semi-Markov model, 
  introduced by Guedon (2005) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2004.05.033>, 
  which also includes several tools for handling missing data, 
  fitting regime sweaching regression and auto-regressive 
  hidden hybrid Markov/semi-Markov model, and many other useful tools.
